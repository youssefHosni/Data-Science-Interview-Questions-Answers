## Questions & Answers ##

### Q1: What are autoencoders? Explain the different layers of autoencoders and mention three practical usages of them? ###

Answer:

Autoencoders are one of the deep learning types used for unsupervised learning. There are key layers of autoencoders, which are the input layer, encoder, bottleneck hidden layer, decoder, and output.

The three layers of the autoencoder are:-
1) Encoder - Compresses the input data to an encoded representation which is typically much smaller than the input data.
2) Latent Space Representation/ Bottleneck/ Code - Compact summary of the input containing the most important features
3) Decoder - Decompresses the knowledge representation and reconstructs the data back from its encoded form.
Then a loss function is used at the top to compare the input and output images.
NOTE- It's a requirement that the dimensionality of the input and output be the same. Everything in the middle can be played with.

Autoencoders have a wide variety of usage in the real world. The following are some of the popular ones:

1. Transformers and Big Bird (Autoencoders is one of these components in both algorithms): Text Summarizer, Text Generator
2. Image compression
3. Nonlinear version of PCA


### Q2: What is an activation function and discuss the use of an activation function? Explain three different types of activation functions? ###

Answer:

In mathematical terms, the activation function serves as a gate between the current neuron input and its output, going to the next level. Basically, it decides whether neurons should be activated or not.
It is used to introduce non-linearity into a model.

Activation functions are added to introduce non-linearity to the network, it doesn't matter how many layers or how many neurons your net has, the output will be linear combinations of the input in the absence of activation functions. In other words, activation functions are what make a linear regression model different from a neural network. We need non-linearity, to capture more complex features and model more complex variations that simple linear models can not capture.

There are a lot of activation functions:

* Sigmoid function: f(x) = 1/(1+exp(-x))

The output value of it is between 0 and 1, we can use it for classification. It has some problems like the gradient vanishing on the extremes, also it is computationally expensive since it uses exp.

* Relu: f(x) = max(0,x)

it returns 0 if the input is negative and the value of the input if the input is positive. It solves the problem of vanishing gradient for the positive side, however, the problem is still on the negative side. It is fast because we use a linear function in it.

* Leaky ReLU:

F(x)= ax, x<0
F(x)= x, x>=0

It solves the problem of vanishing gradient on both sides by returning a value “a” on the negative side and it does the same thing as ReLU for the positive side.

* Softmax: it is usually used at the last layer for a classification problem because it returns a set of probabilities, where the sum of them is 1. Moreover, it is compatible with cross-entropy loss, which is usually the loss function for classification problems.


### Q3: You are using a deep neural network for a prediction task. After training your model, you notice that it is strongly overfitting the training set and that the performance on the test isn’t good. What can you do to reduce overfitting? ###

To reduce overfitting in a deep neural network changes can be made in three places/stages: The input data to the network, the network architecture, and the training process:

1. The input data to the network:

* Check if all the features are available and reliable
* Check if the training sample distribution is the same as the validation and test set distribution. Because if there is a difference in validation set distribution then it is hard for the model to predict as these complex patterns are unknown to the model.
* Check for train / valid data contamination (or leakage)
* The dataset size is enough, if not try data augmentation to increase the data size
* The dataset is balanced

2. Network architecture:
* Overfitting could be due to model complexity. Question each component:
  * can fully connect layers be replaced with convolutional + pooling layers?
  * what is the justification for the number of layers and number of neurons chosen? Given how hard it is to tune these, can a pre-trained model be used?
  * Add regularization - lasso (l1), ridge (l2), elastic net (both)
* Add dropouts
* Add batch normalization

3. The training process:
* Improvements in validation losses should decide when to stop training. Use callbacks for early stopping when there are no significant changes in the validation loss and restore_best_weights.

### Q4: Why should we use Batch Normalization? ###

Batch normalization is a technique for training very deep neural networks that standardizes the inputs to a layer for each mini-batch.

Usually, a dataset is fed into the network in the form of batches where the distribution of the data differs for every batch size. By doing this, there might be chances of vanishing gradient or exploding gradient when it tries to backpropagate. In order to combat these issues, we can use BN (with irreducible error) layer mostly on the inputs to the layer before the activation function in the previous layer and after fully connected layers.


Batch Normalisation has the following effects on the Neural Network:

1. Robust Training of the deeper layers of the network.
2. Better covariate-shift proof NN Architecture.
3. Has a slight regularisation effect.
4. Centred and Controlled values of Activation.
5. Tries to Prevent exploding/vanishing gradient.
6. Faster Training/Convergence to the minimum loss function

### Q5: How to know whether your model is suffering from the problem of Exploding Gradients? ###

By taking incremental steps towards the minimal value, the gradient descent algorithm aims to minimize the error. The weights and biases in a neural network are updated using these processes. However, at times, the steps grow excessively large, resulting in increased updates to weights and bias terms to the point where the weights overflow (or become NaN, that is, Not a Number). An exploding gradient is the result of this, and it is an unstable method.

There are some subtle signs that you may be suffering from exploding gradients during the training of your network, such as:

1. The model is unable to get traction on your training data (e g. poor loss).
2. The model is unstable, resulting in large changes in loss from update to update.
3. The model loss goes to NaN during training.

If you have these types of problems, you can dig deeper to see if you have a problem with exploding gradients. There are some less subtle signs that you can use to confirm that you have exploding gradients:

1. The model weights quickly become very large during training.
2. The model weights go to NaN values during training.
3. The error gradient values are consistently above 1.0 for each node and layer during training.

### Q6: Can you name and explain a few hyperparameters used for training a neural network? ###

Answer:

Hyperparameters are any parameter in the model that affects the performance but is not learned from the data unlike parameters ( weights and biases), the only way to change it is manually by the user.


1. Number of nodes: number of inputs in each layer.

2. Batch normalization: normalization/standardization of inputs in a layer.

3. Learning rate: the rate at which weights are updated.

4. Dropout rate: percent of nodes to drop temporarily during the forward pass.

5. Kernel: matrix to perform dot product of image array with

6. Activation function: defines how the weighted sum of inputs is transformed into outputs (e.g. tanh, sigmoid, softmax, Relu, etc)

7. Number of epochs: number of passes an algorithm has to perform for training

8. Batch size: number of samples to pass through the algorithm individually. E.g. if the dataset has 1000 records and we set a batch size of 100 then the dataset will be divided into 10 batches which will be propagated to the algorithm one after another.

9. Momentum: Momentum can be seen as a learning rate adaptation technique that adds a fraction of the past update vector to the current update vector. This helps damps oscillations and speed up progress towards the minimum.

10. Optimizers: They focus on getting the learning rate right.

* Adagrad optimizer: Adagrad uses a large learning rate for infrequent features and a smaller learning rate for frequent features.

* Other optimizers, like Adadelta, RMSProp, and Adam, make further improvements to fine-tuning the learning rate and momentum to get to the optimal weights and bias. Thus getting the learning rate right is key to well-trained models.

11. Learning Rate: Controls how much to update weights & bias (w+b) terms after training on each batch. Several helpers are used to getting the learning rate right.

### Q7: Can you explain the parameter sharing concept in deep learning? ###
Answer:
Parameter sharing is the method of sharing weights by all neurons in a particular feature map. Therefore helps to reduce the number of parameters in the whole system, making it computationally cheap. It basically means that the same parameters will be used to represent different transformations in the system. This basically means the same matrix elements may be updated multiple times during backpropagation from varied gradients. The same set of elements will facilitate transformations at more than one layer instead of those from a single layer as conventional. This is usually done in architectures like Siamese that tend to have parallel trunks trained simultaneously. In that case, using shared weights in a few layers( usually the bottom layers) helps the model converge better. This behavior, as observed, can be attributed to more diverse feature representations learned by the system. Since neurons corresponding to the same features are triggered in varied scenarios. Helps to model to generalize better.



Note that sometimes the parameter sharing assumption may not make sense. This is especially the case when the input images to a ConvNet have some specific centered structure, where we should expect, for example, that completely different features should be learned on one side of the image than another. 

One practical example is when the input is faces that have been centered in the image. You might expect that different eye-specific or hair-specific features could (and should) be learned in different spatial locations. In that case, it is common to relax the parameter sharing scheme, and instead, simply call the layer a Locally-Connected Layer.

### Q8: Describe the architecture of a typical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)? ###

Answer:

In a typical CNN architecture, a few convolutional layers are connected in a cascade style. Each convolutional layer is followed by a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) layer or other activation function, then a pooling layer*, then one or more convolutional layers (+ReLU), then another pooling layer.

The output from each convolution layer is a set of objects called feature maps, generated by a single kernel filter. The feature maps are used to define a new input to the next layer. A common trend is to keep on increasing the number of filters as the size of the image keeps dropping as it passes through the Convolutional and Pooling layers. The size of each kernel filter is usually 3×3 kernel because it can extract the same features which extract from large kernels and faster than them.

After that, the final small image with a large number of filters(which is a 3D output from the above layers) is flattened and passed through fully connected layers. At last, we use a softmax layer with the required number of nodes for classification or use the output of the fully connected layers for some other purpose depending on the task.

The number of these layers can increase depending on the complexity of the data and when they increase you need more data. Stride, Padding, Filter size, Type of Pooling, etc all are Hyperparameters and need to be chosen (maybe based on some previously built successful models)

*Pooling: it is a way to reduce the number of features by choosing a number to represent its neighbor. And it has many types max-pooling, average pooling, and global average.

* Max pooling: it takes the max number of window 2×2 as an example and represents this window by using the max number in it then slides on the image to make the same operation.
* Average pooling: it is the same as max-pooling but takes the average of the window.

### Q9: What is the Vanishing Gradient Problem in Artificial Neural Networks and How to fix it? ###

Answer:

The vanishing gradient problem is encountered in artificial neural networks with gradient-based learning methods and backpropagation. In these learning methods, each of the weights of the neural network receives an update proportional to the partial derivative of the error function with respect to the current weight in each iteration of training. Sometimes when gradients become vanishingly small, this prevents the weight to change value.

When the neural network has many hidden layers, the gradients in the earlier layers will become very low as we multiply the derivatives of each layer. As a result, learning in the earlier layers becomes very slow. 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐜𝐚𝐮𝐬𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐧𝐞𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐧𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤 𝐭𝐨 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐩 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠. This problem of vanishing gradient descent happens when training neural networks with many layers because the gradient diminishes dramatically as it propagates backward through the network.

Some ways to fix it are:
1. Use skip/residual connections.
2. Using ReLU or Leaky ReLU over sigmoid and tanh activation functions.
3. Use models that help propagate gradients to earlier time steps like in GRUs and LSTMs.

### Q10:  When it comes to training an artificial neural network, what could be the reason why the loss doesn't decrease in a few epochs? ###

Answer:

Some of the reasons why the loss doesn't decrease after a few Epochs are:

a) The model is under-fitting the training data.

b) The learning rate of the model is large.

c) The initialization is not proper (like all the weights initialized with 0 doesn't make the network learn any function)

d) The Regularisation hyper-parameter is quite large.

e).  The classic case of vanishing gradients

### Q11: Why Sigmoid or Tanh is not preferred to be used as the activation function in the hidden layer of the neural network? ###

Answer:

A common problem with Tanh or Sigmoid functions is that they saturate. Once saturated, the learning algorithms cannot adapt to the weights and enhance the performance of the model.
Thus, Sigmoid or Tanh activation functions prevent the neural network from learning effectively leading to a vanishing gradient problem. The vanishing gradient problem can be addressed with the use of Rectified Linear Activation Function (ReLu) instead of sigmoid and Tanh.

### Q12: Discuss in what context it is recommended to use transfer learning and when it is not. ###

Answer:

Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. It is a popular approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point for computer vision and natural language processing tasks given the vast computing and time resources required to develop neural network models on these problems and from the huge jumps in a skill that they provide on related problems.

Transfer learning is used for tasks where the data is too little to train a full-scale model from the beginning. In transfer learning, well-trained, well-constructed networks are used which have learned over large sets and can be used to boost the performance of a dataset.

𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐟𝐞𝐫 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐛𝐞 𝐮𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐬:
1. The downstream task has a very small amount of data available, then we can try using pre-trained model weights by switching the last layer with new layers which we will train.

2. In some cases, like in vision-related tasks, the initial layers have a common behavior of detecting edges, then a little more complex but still abstract features and so on which is common in all vision tasks, and hence a pre-trained model's initial layers can be used directly. The same thing holds for Language Models too, for example, a model trained in a large Hindi corpus can be transferred and used for other Indo-Aryan Languages with low resources available.


𝐂𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐬 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐧 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐟𝐞𝐫 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐛𝐞 𝐮𝐬𝐞𝐝:

1. The first and most important is the "COST". So is it cost-effective or we can have a similar performance without using it.

2. The pre-trained model has no relation to the downstream task.

3. If the latency is a big constraint (Mostly in NLP ) then transfer learning is not the best option. However Now with the TensorFlow lite kind of platform and Model Distillation, Latency is not a problem anymore.

### Q13: Discuss the vanishing gradient in RNN and How they can be solved. ###

Answer:

In Sequence to Sequence models such as RNNs, the input sentences might have long-term dependencies for example we might say "The boy who was wearing a red t-shirt, blue jeans, black shoes, and a white cap and who lives at ... and is 10 years old ...... etc, is genius" here the verb (is) in the sentence depends on the (boy) i.e if we say (The boys, ......, are genius". When training an RNN we do backward propagation both through layers and backward through time. Without focusing too much on mathematics, during backward propagation we tend to multiply gradients that are either > 1 or < 1, if the gradients are < 1 and we have about 100 steps backward in time then multiplying 100 numbers that are < 1 will result in a very very tiny gradient causing no change in the weights as we go backward in time (0.1 * 0.1 * 0.1 * .... a 100 times = 10^(-100)) such that in our previous example the word "is" doesn't affect its main dependency the word "boy" during learning the meanings of the word due to the long description in between.

Models like the Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and the Long short-term memory (LSTMs) were proposed, the main idea of these models is to use gates to help the network determine which information to keep and which information to discard during learning. Then Transformers were proposed depending on the self-attention mechanism to catch the dependencies between words in the sequence.

### Q14: What are the main gates in LSTM and what are their tasks? ###

Answer:
There are 3 main types of gates in a LSTM Model, as follows:
- Forget Gate
- Input/Update Gate
- Output Gate
1) Forget Gate:- It helps in deciding which data to keep or thrown out
2) Input Gate:- it helps in determining whether new data should be added in long term memory cell given by previous hidden state and new input data 
3) Output Gate:- this gate gives out the new hidden state

Common things for all these gates are they all take take inputs as the current temporal state/input/word/observation and the previous hidden state output and sigmoid activation is mostly used in all of these.

### Q15: Is it a good idea to use CNN to classify 1D signal? ###

Answer:
For time-series data, where we assume temporal dependence between the values, then convolutional neural networks (CNN) are one of the possible approaches. However the most popular approach to such data is to use recurrent neural networks (RNN), but you can alternatively use CNNs, or a hybrid approach (quasi-recurrent neural networks, QRNN).

With **CNN**, you would use sliding windows of some width, that would look at certain (learned) patterns in the data, and stack such windows on top of each other, so that higher-level windows would look for patterns within the lower-level patterns. Using such sliding windows may be helpful for finding things such as repeating patterns within the data. One drawback is that it doesn't take into account the temporal or sequential aspect of the 1D signals, which can be very important for prediction.

With **RNN**, you would use a cell that takes as input the previous hidden state and current input value, to return output and another hidden form, so the information flows via the hidden states and takes into account the temporal dependencies.

**QRNN** layers mix both approaches.

### Q16: How does L1/L2 regularization affect a neural network? ###

Answer:

Overfitting occurs in more complex neural network models (many layers, many neurons) and the complexity of the neural network can be reduced by using L1 and L2 regularization as well as dropout.
L1 regularization forces the weight parameters to become zero. L2 regularization forces the weight parameters towards zero (but never exactly zero)

Smaller weight parameters make some neurons neglectable therfore neural network becomes less complex and less overfitting.

Regularisation has the following benefits: 
- Reducing the variance of the model over unseen data.
- Makes it feasible to fit much more complicated models without overfitting.
- Reduces the magnitude of weights and biases.
- L1 learns sparse models that is many weights turn out to be 0.

### Q17: 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐰𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞 𝐚 𝐩𝐫𝐞-𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐝 𝐧𝐞𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐧𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐨 𝐫𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧? ###

Answer:
Using transfer learning where we can use our knowledge about one task to do another. First set of layers of a neural network are usually feature extraction layers and will be useful for all tasks with the same input distribution. So, we should replace the last fully connected layer and Softmax responsible for classification with one neuron for regression-or fully connected-layer for correction then one neuron for regression.

We can optionally freeze the first set of layers if we have few data or to converge fast. Then we can train the network with the data we have and using the suitable loss for the regression problem, making use of the robust feature extraction -first set of layers- of a pre-trained model on huge data.

### Q18: What might happen if you set the momentum hyperparameter too close to 1 (e.g., 0.9999) when using an SGD optimizer? ###

Answer:

If the momentum hyperparameter is set too close to 1 (e.g., 0.99999) when using an SGD optimizer, then the algorithm will likely pick up a lot of speed, hopefully moving roughly toward the global minimum, but its momentum will carry it right past the minimum.

Then it will slow down and come back, accelerate again, overshoot again, and so on. It may oscillate this way many times before converging, so overall it will take much longer to converge than with a smaller momentum value.

Also since the momentum is used to update the weights based on an "exponential moving average" of all the previous gradients instead of the current gradient only, this in some sense, combats the instability of the gradients that comes with stochastic gradient descent, the higher the momentum term, the stronger the influence of previous gradients to the current optimization step (with the more recent gradients having even stronger influence), setting a momentum term close to 1, will result in a gradient that is almost a sum of all the previous gradients basically, which might result in an exploding gradient scenario.

### Q19: What are the hyperparameters that can be optimized for the batch normalization layer? ###

Answer:


### Q20: What is the effect of dropout on the training and prediction speed of your deep learning model? ###

Answer: Dropout is a regularization technique, which zeroes down some weights and scales up the rest of the weights by a factor of 1/(1-p). Let's say if Dropout layer is initialized with p=0.5, that means half of the weights will zeroed down, and rest will be scaled by a factor of 2. This layer is only enabled during training and is disabled during validation and testing. Hence validation and testing is faster. The reason why it works only during training is, we want to reduce the complexity of the model so that model doesn't overfit. Once the model is trained, it doesn't make sense to keep that layer enabled.


### Q21: What is the advantage of deep learning over traditional machine learning? ###

Answer: 

Deep learning offers several advantages over traditional machine learning approaches, including:

1. Ability to process large amounts of data: Deep learning models can analyze and process massive amounts of data quickly and accurately, making it ideal for tasks such as image recognition or natural language processing.

2. Automated feature extraction: In traditional machine learning, feature engineering is a crucial step in the model building process. Deep learning models, on the other hand, can automatically learn and extract features from the raw data, reducing the need for human intervention.

3. Better accuracy: Deep learning models have shown to achieve higher accuracy levels in complex tasks such as speech recognition and image classification when compared to traditional machine learning models.

4. Adaptability to new data: Deep learning models can adapt and learn from new data, making them suitable for use in dynamic and ever-changing environments.

While deep learning does have its advantages, it also has some limitations, such as requiring large amounts of data and computational resources, making it unsuitable for some applications.





### Q22: What is a depthwise Separable layer and what are its advantages? ###

Answer: 

Standard neural network Convolution layers involve a lot of multiplications that make them unsuitable for deployment.

In this above scenario, we have an input image of 12x12x3 pixels and we apply a 5x5 convolution(no padding, stride = 1). We stack 256 such kernels
so that we get an output of dimensions 8x8x256.

Here, there are 256 5x5x3 kernels that move 8x8 times which leads to 256x3x5x5x8x8 = 1,28,800 multiplications.

Depthwise separable convolution separates this process into two parts: a depthwise convolution and a pointwise convolution.

In depthwise convolution, we apply a kernel parallelly to each channel of the image.

We end up getting 3 different outputs (representing 3 channels of the image) to get an 8x8x1 image. These are stacked together to form a 8x8x3 image.

Pointwise Convolution now converts this 8x8x3 image input from the depthwise convolution back to an 8x8x1 output.

Stacking 256 1x1x3 kernels give us the final output as the standard convolution.

Total Number of multiplications:

For Depthwise convolution, we have 3 5x5x1 kernels moving 8x8 times, totalling 3x5x5x8x8=4800 multiplications.

In Pointwise convolution, we have 256 1x1x3 kernels moving 8x8 times, which is a total of 256x1x1x3x8x8=49152 multiplications.

Total number of multiplications = 4800 + 49152 = 53952 multiplications which is way lower than the standard convolution case.
